      <p>Let's make some happy little <em>chocolate pizzas</em> in our world. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Take your time. Speed will come later. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Now then, let's play.
      </p>
      <p>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Chocolate pizzas are free they come and go as they please. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>Let's build an almighty chocolate pizza. Let your heart be your guide. In your world you can create anything you desire. We'll play with clouds today. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.
